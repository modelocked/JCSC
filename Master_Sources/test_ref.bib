Unmanned Aerial Systems’
Influences on Conflict
Escalation Dynamics
AUGUST 2018
CSIS BRIEFS
THE ISSUE
Large, optionally-armed, long-loiter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have proliferated. As more UAS operate in conflict
areas, more incidents of attack or defense will involve said systems. This CSIS Brief details how escalation and deterrence
dynamics change with the increasing use of UAS in conflict areas and examines several cases of how these dynamics might
realistically occur.
The study captures three key findings:
Potential changes to escalation are not well—or consistently—understood.
Offense and defense calculations are weighed differently.
Foreign countries are exploring escalation dynamics through real-time tactical operations.
The study concludes that the possibility of a gap between the intended signal and interpretation of that signal leaves room
for unintended consequences. However, short of greater�},

it would be a battery-powered, remote-control airplane with a plunger
mechanism in its nose, designed to blow up several pounds of explosives when
it crashed into a target on the ground like a taxiing commercial airplane. Or it
could be a multirotor drone, made of hardened plastic, built for the consumer market but modified, so it can carry a bomb to drop onto a crowd of people
waiting for a shuttle bus. Either of these unmanned aerial systems (UAS) would be hard to observe visually or detect with radar, let alone defeat before they
hit their targets. What would the aftermath of such attacks be like? Imagine the consequences in terms of damage, injuries, and fatalities. Consider the impact on the transportation network. Reason through the political repercussions and the effects on the government following the attack, and after the inevitable dissection
of the intelligence, security, and operations failures that left the targeted airport vulnerable. The final accounting could be inestimably bad for those concerned.�},

  abstract    = {The Military Utility, National Security, and Economics Working GroupI examined the U.S. military and
intelligence services’ increasing reliance on and use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology. The
working group considered the capabilities likely to be needed for U.S. military and national security planning in the future and the growing commercial market driving technology innovation. The group also
considered the economic viability of UAS and whether they are an effective tool for fulfilling U.S. national
security goals.
The primary scope of this working group was to consider the use of military UAS to conduct lethal operations. The working group limited its discussion to topics surrounding near-term lethal capabilities of UAS,
and therefore issues pertaining to the potential use of autonomous UAS fell outside the scope of the group’s
efforts. Yet, as non-lethal UAS technologies continue to evolve and spur the advancement of lethal UAS,
particularly in light of the rapidly growing commercial UAS sector, the working group did discuss other
related domains as needed.
Controversy swirls around the use of drones, or as they are more formally known, UAS. But this controversy too often distorts the UAS debate, and concentrates solely on the use of UAS for targeted strikes off the hot-battlefield. In order to unpack the issues related to U.S. military and national security planning, the
broader context of UAS utility should be considered — both from the military and civilian perspectives.
While very real policy concerns exist and must be addressed, these concerns must be considered in the
context of not just lethal UAS strikes, but from the value UAS provide in non-kinetic missions, which are
too often overlooked by UAS critics.
UAS share some distinct attributes, which have made them attractive for military, domestic law enforcement, counter-drug, border protection, and counterterrorism operations as well as for commercial applications. These attributes are not mutually exclusive and thus have some overlap.
• Persistence: UAS have the ability to loiter over a specific area for extended periods of time, allowing
them to capture and collect more information, allowing the user to observe, evaluate, and act quickly.
• Precision: In military applications, UAS sensor technology can provide for more precise information
collection that facilitates more accurate targeting as well as battlefield and non-battlefield surveillance. • Operational Reach: Because of longer flying times, UAS can be used to project force from afar in environments that may otherwise be inaccessible or too dangerous for manned operations.
• Protection of U.S. forces: UAS allow the user to have a military presence in areas that would be otherwise politically impossible, capacity/resource prohibitive, too dangerous to risk being shot down, or
topographically inhospitable.
• Cost effectiveness: Although the actual costs of UAS vary depending on size, hardware, software, support crew, etc., some argue that UAS are more cost-effective than manned aircraft.
The Department of Defense’s (DoD) 2013 Industrial Capabilities Report noted that many aspects of UAS
make them a valuable tool for military and non-military markets in the near and long term: The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) segment continues to evolve. As technology matures, operational lessons-learned are analyzed, and long-term strategies are developed beyond current conflicts. As evidenced
by their extensive use in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, UAS have proven themselves an effective tool
for the Warfighter. The capabilities they bring — from providing constant imagery to serving as strike platforms — are now virtually indispensable to combatant commanders.1
The benefits of military UAS, which are used to provide intelligence, surveillance or strike capabilities, have
been recognized by combatant commanders and intelligence services in the United States, but the technology remains only a small percentage of total investment in DoD research, development, and procurement.II
Non-military uses of UAS are vast and the commercial market for UAS will likely drive innovation in the
near future, both in the United States and abroad. However, concerns about U.S. controls on UAS export
and domestic restrictions have led some to worry that the future of the U.S. industry in UAS will be stifled
and that foreign competitors will overtake U.S. dominance of UAS technology. Indeed, as the DoD stated
in the 2013 Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap:
“…DoD’s total research, procurement, and sustainment costs are relatively small compared to the spending
on manned platforms… The civil UAS market also shows great promise and the potential applications are
virtually endless, if regulatory standards, certification, and operational procedures can be resolved for full
integration into the National Airspace System. Greater computing power, combined with developments
in miniaturization, sensors, and artificial intelligence, have and will continue to dramatically boost UAS
capabilities... However, there is concern that if the U.S. does not resolve export issues with respect to UAS,
this segment will suffer a fate similar to that of the U.S. satellite industry, where a dominant position in the
market was ceded to competitors because of unique U.S. export controls.”2

  abstract    = {Section II: Creativity and Complications: The Dark Side of UAS Use
and Emerging Technologies
The accessibility of commercial drones has led to an explosion in use of the devices by private citizens.
It has also contributed to the fairly rapid development of new ways to use UASs, from fighting forest
fires and assisting search-and-rescue missions to delivering packages and racing for sport. There is
an obvious benefit to society from these developments, as in many ways UASs can be used to gain efficiencies and to contribute to the public good. Indeed, as noted by Paul Scharre, “uninhabited systems
can not only save human lives by undertaking dangerous missions in their place, they can enable new
concepts of operation that would not be possible were human lives at risk.”292
While private-sector drone makers and software developers are providing the tools to enable UAS
exploration, the decentralization of UAS technology has created a playing field in which individual
users are limited only by their own imaginations and the various government regulations to which
they choose to abide—if the regulations even exist. In this way, when it comes to innovation in UAS
use, creativity is king. A number of emerging technologies like autonomy, miniaturization and swarms,
and further advancements and increased accessibility of sensors (e.g., forward looking infrared, known
by the acronym FLIR) and software (e.g., terrain mapping) will only perpetuate these UAS use trends
and extend the realm of the possible.
The dark side to all of this is that innocuous UAS use demonstrated by one person could be exploited by those with more sinister motives. To that end, and to demonstrate more fully what already lies
within the realm of the possible for a terrorist group, this section catalogs a number of creative ways
that drones have been used by private individuals who did not have terror intent, but whose UAS use
could be mimicked or repurposed by others to inflict harm. By focusing on what private citizens have
already achieved, we avoid the pitfalls associated with unconstrained brainstorming and “what-if”
scenario development about how drones can be used, and limit our discussion to those incidents to
which “proof of practicality” applies.293 The section concludes with a brief review of emerging technology trends, and discusses how they will complicate future�},

Transformation is not synonymous with modernization. According to the U.S. Air Force Transformation Flight Plan, the former leads to major improvements in warfighting capabilities and the latter involves incremental upgrades. There is no single metric or framework that distinguishes among concepts that are transformational and those that are not. "In the end, determining what is transformational comes down to qualitative judgement calls by informed senior leadership."

To indicate that transformation is a matter of judgement implies that the process of defining it will continue to be debated by the military, with clear implications for service cultures, budgets, and programs. Subtle semantic and conceptual differences remain key to this struggle. Each service has an idea of future warfare, and rhetorical confusion is likely as various actors invoke terms differently.

Combat practice has on many occasions shown the erroneousness of views downplaying the role of the defense. As a rule, warring sides had to repulse enemy attacks on an ever growing scale and for increasing periods. Troops had to look for effective methods of preparation and conduct of the defense at the cost of heavy losses, correcting the mistakes that were made in military theory. The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 was not an exception in this regard.

Despite the fact that a number of advanced, forward-looking concepts of the military art evolved in the early 1930s (in particular, the theory of operation in depth), clearly insufficient consideration was given to the theory of preparation and conduct of defensive operations. As A.A. Svechin pointed out, the Red Army HS disrespect for the defense resulted from failure to understand the dialectic relationship between the offensive and the defensive. "He who cannot defend himself will not be able to mount a successful offensive," he stressed. "It is critical to use firm defense in order to prepare an effective offensive; an offensive operation needs a good foundation to build on."

History has proven that the sad truth of the fluid and more rapidly changing philosophies and tools of war is that they are usually only noticed after the fact, typically catching military (and political) leaders martially flat-footed. The true nature of RMA becomes readily apparent to militaries, which fall victim to the evolutionary principles of survival of the fittest and serve to demonstrate how those unaware of changing times are destined to be represented in textbooks as historical failures. Furthermore, for inexplicable reasons, both military and political leaders seemingly ignore the winds of change until they are consumed by the firestorm that usually accompanies revolutions of any nature.

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to discuss and assess the tension between ideas that underpin the revolution in military affairs (RMA) and the changing nature of post-Cold War conflict with specific reference to the nature of low-intensity conflict (LIC). The United States' (US) view of an RMA is used as a point of departure as it forms part of the mainstream thinking on the debate. It is argued that the conventional and inter-state war paradigm in the current RMA-debate seems largely irrelevant to the nature of LIC, which is the most probable type of conflict strong powers will face in future. The terror attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 reinforced this critique of the RMA vision and indicated the rise of asymmetric strategies. Hence this article discusses the tension between RMA-thinking and the nature of LIC, also considering the impact of September 11. It addresses the preparation for certain scenarios, existing national values, operational thinking and the use of military instruments.},
