Tuesday – Day 2

Day 1, I came home quite disheartened, feeling that we were, once again, just learning information for the sake of it, not really, you know, let’s do a master’s for the sake of it.

Today then, we were talking, we had Rory Finnegan primarily, and somebody else then from DCU talking about Realpolitik and the realist and liberal approaches and the neoliberalism, and, sorry, neorealism, excuse me, not neoliberalism, and I thought it was interesting, but it wasn’t going any place for me.

And then on the way home, I was talking with Brian and Liam, and I was saying that I was reading Colin Gray’s 2018 book on policy, sorry, on strategy, and I think I was saying that I was understanding that strategy is about consequences, political consequences. Operations are about the movement of resources and whatnot to achieve what is done at the tactical level. The tactical level is where the killing is done, and that can be anywhere by any amount of forces, but ultimately, operations are about putting those people into the position where the killing can happen at the tactical level.

And then he was talking about ends, ways and means, and I think ends are the political piece, that’s the policy. The ways are, I think, the strategy to achieve those, which are long-term, you might never conceive them, and the means are the tactics, the actual tactical outputs that you’re having.

Then I was thinking that, I still was thinking that, and all of this is kind of nonsense really, that it’s going nowhere, what’s the bloody point of listening to it? And then just reading for something else, I was reading Colin Gray’s book, sorry, I was reading Eliot Cohen’s 2002 paper, Eliot Cohen’s 2002 paper called, I can’t remember exactly what it’s called, but any of these papers on about the friction, the friction between the civilians and the military, and that there has to be friction in your job, and he mentioned the operational level, and I was thinking then, trying to square that with Gray’s book, saying well actually, you shouldn’t just be mouthing off at the operational level, like you still don’t understand where the military guys fit in with the strategy, and then I realised that the military strategic thinkers, they have to be, they have to understand the geopolitics, the economics, the culture, all these sorts of things, so that they can influence the political policy, and thereafter can come up with probably, and that’s at maybe the cabinet level, maybe, or maybe at parliament level, and then at the operational level, which might be them engaging with the Department of Defence, that’s definitely frictional, definitely a bounce back of ideas and whatnot, and you just can’t do it effectively unless you know about them.

Then I was reading Gray’s 2005 paper, How Has War Changed Since the End of the Cold War, and he’s on about, I don’t know what he’s on about, but that’s what I have at the moment.and.

Then, the nature of war is about being politics by other means. It's about effecting policy using military tools. Whereas the character of war is something I suppose I'd be more familiar with. GRAY_2018 AND COHEN_2002
