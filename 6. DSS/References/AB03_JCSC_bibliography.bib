Soviet defense experts, who were intrinsically more comfortable with the notion that history's linear evolution is occasionally interrupted by rapid discontinuities known as "revolutions," had begun exploration of the idea. But even though the Soviets had an inkling of the changes in warfare that the late 20th century would bring, they did not have the technological base or the capability for creative organizational reform to actually undertake a revolution. They were the intellectual founding fathers of the current revolution in military affairs, but not its architects, playing the role of Marx rather than Lenin. But Americans were different. For a variety of reasons, they were both open to new ideas about warfare and able to capitalize on them.},

One identifies transformation exclusively with the revolution in military affairs (RMA) and the other perceives it more broadly, as a process of adapting the Armed Forces to the security challenges of the post-Cold War era.

Transformation is not synonymous with modernization. According to the U.S. Air Force Transformation Flight Plan, the former leads to major improvements in warfighting capabilities and the latter involves incremental upgrades. There is no single metric or framework that distinguishes among concepts that are transformational and those that are not. "In the end, determining what is transformational comes down to qualitative judgement calls by informed senior leadership."

To indicate that transformation is a matter of judgement implies that the process of defining it will continue to be debated by the military, with clear implications for service cultures, budgets, and programs. Subtle semantic and conceptual differences remain key to this struggle. Each service has an idea of future warfare, and rhetorical confusion is likely as various actors invoke terms differently. In the end, definitions alone will not resolve differences over transformation.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of military history shows that such a critical form of combat action as the defense was often underestimated with the result that armies were ill-prepared for it. Combat practice has on many occasions shown the erroneousness of views downplaying the role of the defense. As a rule, warring sides had to repulse enemy attacks on an ever growing scale and for increasing periods. Troops had to look for effective methods of preparation and conduct of the defense at the cost of heavy losses, correcting the mistakes that were made in military theory. The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 was not an exception in this regard.

Despite the fact that a number of advanced, forward-looking concepts of the military art evolved in the early 1930s (in particular, the theory of operation in depth), clearly insufficient consideration was given to the theory of preparation and conduct of defensive operations. As A.A. Svechin pointed out, the Red Army HS disrespect for the defense resulted from failure to understand the dialectic relationship between the offensive and the defensive. "He who cannot defend himself will not be able to mount a successful offensive," he stressed. "It is critical to use firm defense in order to prepare an effective offensive; an offensive operation needs a good foundation to build on." [1] The opinion of this outstanding military expert, however, was ignored.},

Some historians point to the period of post-Vietnam introspection in the mid-1970s as the origin. Thus the Nation has been engaged in--or at least on the cusp of--such a revolution (or military transformation) for the better part of two decades, a time span roughly equal to two earlier military revolutions, the interwar transformation and nuclear revolution.},

These changes are not only radical in nature but have increased in frequency and speed of implementation. Some of these changes have been merely shifts in how we think of military operations but some have been true revolutions in mill tary affairs (RMA) and, as such, have fundamentally changed how warfare affects the world.

History has proven that the sad truth of the fluid and more rapidly changing philosophies and tools of war is that they are usually only noticed after the fact, typically catching military (and political) leaders martially flat-footed. The true nature of RMA becomes readily apparent to militaries, which fall victim to the evolutionary principles of survival of the fittest and serve to demonstrate how those unaware of changing times are destined to be represented in textbooks as historical failures. Furthermore, for inexplicable reasons, both military and political leaders seemingly ignore the winds of change until they are consumed by the firestorm that usually accompanies revolutions of any nature. This "head-in-the sand" philosophy only further serves to make RMA more sudden and far reaching in impact.},

Bloch foresaw with stunning prescience how smokeless gunpowder, improved rifles, and other emerging technologies would overturn contemporary thinking about the character and conduct of war. (Bloch also got one major thing wrong: he thought the sheer carnage of modern combat would be so horrific that war would "become impossible.") What Bloch anticipated has come to be known as a "revolution in military affairs"--the emergence of technologies so disruptive that they overtake existing military concepts and capabilities and necessitate a rethinking of how, with what, and by whom war is waged. Such a revolution is unfolding today. Artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, ubiquitous sensors, advanced manufacturing, and quantum science will transform warfare as radically as the technologies that consumed Bloch. And yet the U.S. government's thinking about how to employ these new technologies is not keeping pace with their development.},

Given special access to classified data and key individuals involved in planning and executing the campaign, they argue persuasively that technological advances, including stealth, laser-guided munitions, and anti-radiation missiles, permitted air power to operate at unprecedented levels of effectiveness. But they also rigorously detail air power's limitations, including its inability to eliminate the Iraqi nuclear weapons program, neutralize the Scud missile threat, or shatter Saddam Hussein's hold on power through attacks on the Iraqi leadership. The book's liberal use of charts and tables--a number of which are difficult to read or interpret--both reward and punish the reader. But taken as a whole, the book presents as comprehensive an assessment of the role of air power in the war as is likely to be written for a long time.},

But even though the Soviets had an inkling of the changes in warfare that the late 20th century would bring, they did not have the technological base or the capability for creative organizational reform to actually undertake a revolution. They were the intellectual founding fathers of the current revolution in military affairs, but not its architects, playing the role of Marx rather than Lenin. But Americans were different. For a variety of reasons, they were both open to new ideas about warfare and able to capitalize on them.},

The United States' (US) view of an RMA is used as a point of departure as it forms part of the mainstream thinking on the debate. It is argued that the conventional and inter-state war paradigm in the current RMA-debate seems largely irrelevant to the nature of LIC, which is the most probable type of conflict strong powers will face in future. The terror attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 reinforced this critique of the RMA vision and indicated the rise of asymmetric strategies. Hence this article discusses the tension between RMA-thinking and the nature of LIC, also considering the impact of September 11. It addresses the preparation for certain scenarios, existing national values, operational thinking and the use of military instruments.},
