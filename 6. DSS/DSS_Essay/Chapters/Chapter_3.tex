\chapter{Against the proposal that small states can influence internationally - provided they have credibility}
``the status and prestige of Small Powers has
risen, while their relative strength in the traditional elements of power has
actually declined" \parencite{ROTHSTEIN_1966}


\textcite{HANDEL_2005} observes that, for small states, domestic drivers of foreign policy are secondary to the international system. This indicates that effective leaders are more likely to adopt neorealist or liberal IR frames. This aligns with the reviewed literature \parencite{BAILES_2013,WALTZ_1969,BAILES_2012,BECKLEY_2018,THORHALLSSON_2006,TONRA_1999}. Going further, the influence of small states must be assessed within (and as a function of) the international system. Put differently, an influential small state at time t1 in system A will have different influence at time t2 in system B. Indeed, this implies that their strategies must adapt to external structures rather than set the parameters of the system.
