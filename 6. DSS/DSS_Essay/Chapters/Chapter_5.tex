\chapter{Methodology}
% Approach (qual/quant/mixed), cases + justification, data & analysis,
% limits, ethics. Social-science or humanities angle as per guideline.

This thesis shall adopt the humanities approach. It shall not seek to measure variables or test hypotheses. Instead, it shall interrogate texts and ideas. The intended method shall be one of critical reading of theorists, doctrine, policy papers and case histories, set against one another. The aim is to identify the assumptions which underpin techno-optimist, sceptical and institutional perspectives on the RMA. Through comparison of theory and practice in recent conflicts, the study will weigh whether uncrewed and AI-enabled systems represent genuine discontinuity or the latest turn in an evolutionary cycle. These debates will also be assessed in the context of the Irish Army, to consider their relevance for national doctrine, organisation and command.
