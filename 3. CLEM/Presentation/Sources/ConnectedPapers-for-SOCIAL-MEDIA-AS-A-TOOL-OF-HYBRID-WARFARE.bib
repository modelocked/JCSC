abstract = {Preface: An AwakeningThe neatest trick of the devil is to persuade you that he does not exist.- Charles Baudelaire, 1869 1They began to appear in late February 2014. Equipped with the latest military weapons and gear, stripped of identification and riding unmarked military vehicles, they rapidly seized ground.2 While the world looked on in confusion, in a few weeks it was over; Crimea belonged to the Little Green Men.Several months later, on a beautiful July afternoon, a shower of composite and aluminum aircraft parts suddenly darkened the blue skies of Eastern Ukraine, raining down upon the sunflower fields near Hrabove. The 298 passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were all killed when their Boeing 777 was struck by a Russian-made 9M38 missile, launched by a Buk-Ml anti-aircraft system.* 3 At over 18 feet long, the missile was nearly the size of a telephone pole, and traveling three times the speed of sound.Screened by a schizophrenic torrent of state-sponsored propaganda, the Kremlin maintained innocence, distancing Russia from the controversial events and vehemently denying involvement - despite mounting evidence to the contrary.For many Western audiences, their first introduction to modern Russian propaganda was the frenetic spin cycle surrounding these dramatic events. Described as "darkly, nastily brilliant" and "so much more sophisticated than Soviet propaganda," in the year and a half since Crimea's illegal referendum on independence, journalistic observation and scholarly analysis of the RT television network (formerly Russia Today) and others have helped raise awareness of the Kremlin's coordinated manipulation of Russian mass media.4Unfortunately, RT and other state-controlled media outlets represent only one facet of a much larger influence campaign - a single tool in a range of understudied activities that constitute a concerning gap in the West's broader "soft-containment" of Putin's Russia.An Introduction to "Active Measures"In short, the Soviet approach to international relations can perhaps best be described as a form of "political warfare," with the manipulative and deceptive techniques of active measures playing an essential and important role.- USIA Report, Soviet Active Measures in the "Post-Cold War" Era, 1988-19915 6The Russian Federation is currently waging "the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg ... in the history of information warfare," pursuing a revanchist foreign policy considered by senior diplomatic and military leaders to be a tremendous security threat for both Europe and America.7 While many in the West are by now familiar with Russia's infamous RT network, its state-sponsored media outlets are only the tip of the iceberg - the "white propaganda" component of a much broader system of influence activities designed to shape the global information space.With roots in Leninist thinking, over generations the Soviets mastered a range of techniques known as oktivnyye meropriyotiyo, or "active measures," ranging from simple propaganda and forgery to assassination, terrorism and everything in between. In the West, these politics by other means were simply referred to as "dirty tricks."8Described by Major General Oleg Kalugin, the KGB's highest ranking defector, as "the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence," these "active measures were well integrated into Soviet policy and involved virtually every element of the Soviet party and state structure, not only the KGB."9 As a major component of Soviet foreign policy, these tactics were incredibly well resourced. According to experts, the "Soviet active measures apparatus dwarfed, by a factor of perhaps 20 or 30 to one, the US governmental apparatus set up to analyze and counter its activities."10 At their peak, it is estimated that the Soviet active measures campaign employed up to 15,000 people - more than the number of diplomats serving in the post-9/11 US Department of State. …},

abstract = {IntroductionThe military conflict in the southeast of Ukraine is creating a vast field of research in the most diverse areas and has led to the creation of a local but ongoing combat zone with all its attendant social ramifications. A large number of volunteer battalions were formed within Ukraine during the first months of the war, which became some of its main players. As demonstrated by previous local conflicts in the post-Soviet space like the Chechnya wars and the NagornoKarabakh conflict, the majority of such confrontations do not end when the situation is resolved by the governments of the parties involved. As many of these conflicts have the characteristics of a local civil war, a number of political, so10.11610/Connections.15.1-04 cial, and cultural shifts occur in the conflict zone itself.1 The participants, the volunteers of the battalions who find themselves involved in the conflict for an extended period of time may, when the conflict's hot phase ends, be transformed in the public consciousness from defenders of the homeland into an illegal military group. It is the fact of these fighters' voluntary participation in the hostilities that complicates their subsequent return to civilian life. This occurs especially if a battalion took on substantial political weight over the course of a conflict and later endeavors to influence the situation in domestic policy. As is apparent in the example of the conflict in Mukacheve, this is now a matter of immediate concern for Ukrainian policy and national security.2Thus, the present research is devoted to an examination of the causes and consequences of this issue, and to the phenomenon of members of this battalion making so-called "non-transferable investments."3 The core question posed is the following: how do the personal and social characteristics of the commander of a volunteer battalion affect the level of general non-transferable investments? This research aims to test two hypotheses.Hypothesis 1. The number of non-transferable investments made by a volunteer battalion overall is directly dependent on the commander of that battalion.Hypothesis 2. A battalion commander's propensity for making non-transferable investments depends on his personal and social characteristics.The research examines the following empirical material: volunteer battalions formed during the Ukraine-Russia conflict in 2014-2015; personal and social characteristics of the commanders of those battalions; the battalions' activities during the conflict; media coverage of their activities; and the official assessment of their activities by Ukrainian authorities.To this end, the following research methods were used:* Content analysis of open Ukrainian- and Russian-language media sources on the Internet;* Content analysis of official documents of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, the administration of the President of Ukraine, and Ukrainian government decrees;* Correlational analysis of identified indicators and characteristics based on the data obtained from content analysis;* A method of modeling social processes based on social and political theories and conventions.To test the first hypothesis, the paper shall turn to classical works on the interaction between a leader and a given social group.Sociological and Psychological ValidationIn his work, "The Psychology of Evil," studying the phenomenon of non-transferable investments made by American soldiers in Abu Ghraib, Philip Zimbardo attempts to refute the classic notion that an inclination toward sadistic violence is an innate deviation in a human being.4 Rather, it is relatively rare and applies to only 5% of humans overall.5 The researcher posited that anyoneeven the most seemingly normal person-is capable of cruelty and outward manifestations of violence if a number of factors are present. The core issue Zimbardo studied is that soldiers committed such acts against prisoners of war because they considered this to be the most fully "good" performance of the social role assigned to them; namely, they believed that by beating and abusing prisoners of war they would be able to obtain useful information from them, thereby gaining favor with the command structure. …},

However, the credibility of posted content is still trailed by an interrogation mark. Introduction: In this paper, a model has been developed for finding the user’s credibility based on the tweets which they had posted on Twitter social networks. The model consists of machine learning algorithms that assist not only in categorizing the tweets into credibility classes but also helps in finding user’s credibility ratings on the social media platform. Methods and results: The dataset and associated features of 100,000 tweets were extracted and pre-processed. Furthermore, the credibility class labelling of tweets was performed using four different human annotators. The meaning cloud and natural language understanding platforms were used for calculating the polarity, sentiment, and emotions score. The K-Means algorithm was applied for finding the clusters of tweets based on features set, whereas, random forest, support vector machine, naïve Bayes, K-nearest-neighbours (KNN), J48 decision tree, and multilayer perceptron were used for classifying the tweets into credibility classes. A significant level of accuracy, precision, and recall was provided by all the classifiers for all the given credibility classes.},

abstract = {Data generated on Twitter has become a rich source for various data mining tasks. Those data analysis tasks that are dependent on the tweet semantics, such as sentiment analysis, emotion mining, and rumor detection among others, suffer considerably if the tweet is not credible, not real, or spam. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis on credibility of Arabic content on Twitter. We also build a classification model (CAT) to automatically predict the credibility of a given Arabic tweet. Of particular originality is the inclusion of features extracted directly or indirectly from the author’s profile and timeline. To train and test CAT, we annotated for credibility a data set of 9,000 Arabic tweets that are topic independent. CAT achieved consistent improvements in predicting the credibility of the tweets when compared to several baselines and when compared to the state-of-the-art approach with an improvement of 21% in weighted average F-measure. We also conducted experiments to highlight the importance of the user-based features as opposed to the content-based features. We conclude our work with a feature reduction experiment that highlights the best indicative features of credibility.},

abstract = {During sudden onset crisis events, the presence of spam, rumors and fake content on Twitter reduces the value of information contained on its messages (or "tweets"). A possible solution to this problem is to use machine learning to automatically evaluate the credibility of a tweet, i.e. whether a person would deem the tweet believable or trustworthy. This has been often framed and studied as a supervised classification problem in an off-line (post-hoc) setting. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised ranking model for scoring tweets according to their credibility. This model is used in TweetCred, a real-time system that assigns a credibility score to tweets in a user's timeline. TweetCred, available as a browser plug-in, was installed and used by 1,127 Twitter users within a span of three months. During this period, the credibility score for about 5.4 million tweets was computed, allowing us to evaluate TweetCred in terms of response time, effectiveness and usability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work to develop a real-time system for credibility on Twitter, and to evaluate it on a user base of this size.},

abstract = {After the division of the Indian subcontinent, the conflict is still ongoing between Pakistan and India over the territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Many wars have been fought between the two countries. With the development of the subject of International Relations the concept of irregular warfare also termed as Hybrid Warfare has been introduced. This research paper explores the complex landscape of India’s Hybrid warfare against Pakistan, focusing on a comparative analysis of the strategies employed during the tenures of the Pakistan People Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) governments to counter India’s Hybrid warfare. This study aims to interpret the distinct approaches each government adopted to address this complex irregular warfare. By scrutinizing diplomatic engagements, intelligence operations, and responses to regional challenges, the research seeks to unravel the efficacy of the PPP and PML-N administrations in managing and responding to the multifaceted nature of Indo-Pak relations from a hybrid warfare perspective.},
