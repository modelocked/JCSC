Unmanned Aerial Systems’
Influences on Conflict
Escalation Dynamics
AUGUST 2018
CSIS BRIEFS
THE ISSUE
Large, optionally-armed, long-loiter unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have proliferated. As more UAS operate in conflict
areas, more incidents of attack or defense will involve said systems. This CSIS Brief details how escalation and deterrence
dynamics change with the increasing use of UAS in conflict areas and examines several cases of how these dynamics might
realistically occur.
The study captures three key findings:
Potential changes to escalation are not well—or consistently—understood.
Offense and defense calculations are weighed differently.
Foreign countries are exploring escalation dynamics through real-time tactical operations.
The study concludes that the possibility of a gap between the intended signal and interpretation of that signal leaves room
for unintended consequences. However, short of greater�},

it would be a battery-powered, remote-control airplane with a plunger

it crashed into a target on the ground like a taxiing commercial airplane. Or it
could be a multirotor drone, made of hardened plastic, built for the consumer market but modified, so it can carry a bomb to drop onto a crowd of people
waiting for a shuttle bus. Either of these unmanned aerial systems (UAS) would be hard to observe visually or detect with radar, let alone defeat before they
hit their targets. What would the aftermath of such attacks be like? Imagine the consequences in terms of damage, injuries, and fatalities. Consider the impact on the transportation network. Reason through the political repercussions and the effects on the government following the attack, and after the inevitable dissection

  abstract    = {The Military Utility, National Security, and Economics Working GroupI examined the U.S. military and
intelligence services’ increasing reliance on and use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology. The
working group considered the capabilities likely to be needed for U.S. military and national security planning in the future and the growing commercial market driving technology innovation. The group also
considered the economic viability of UAS and whether they are an effective tool for fulfilling U.S. national
security goals.
The primary scope of this working group was to consider the use of military UAS to conduct lethal operations. The working group limited its discussion to topics surrounding near-term lethal capabilities of UAS,
and therefore issues pertaining to the potential use of autonomous UAS fell outside the scope of the group’s
efforts. Yet, as non-lethal UAS technologies continue to evolve and spur the advancement of lethal UAS,
particularly in light of the rapidly growing commercial UAS sector, the working group did discuss other
related domains as needed.
Controversy swirls around the use of drones, or as they are more formally known, UAS. But this controversy too often distorts the UAS debate, and concentrates solely on the use of UAS for targeted strikes off the hot-battlefield. In order to unpack the issues related to U.S. military and national security planning, the
broader context of UAS utility should be considered — both from the military and civilian perspectives.
While very real policy concerns exist and must be addressed, these concerns must be considered in the
context of not just lethal UAS strikes, but from the value UAS provide in non-kinetic missions, which are
too often overlooked by UAS critics.
UAS share some distinct attributes, which have made them attractive for military, domestic law enforcement, counter-drug, border protection, and counterterrorism operations as well as for commercial applications. These attributes are not mutually exclusive and thus have some overlap.
• Persistence: UAS have the ability to loiter over a specific area for extended periods of time, allowing
them to capture and collect more information, allowing the user to observe, evaluate, and act quickly.
• Precision: In military applications, UAS sensor technology can provide for more precise information
collection that facilitates more accurate targeting as well as battlefield and non-battlefield surveillance. • Operational Reach: Because of longer flying times, UAS can be used to project force from afar in environments that may otherwise be inaccessible or too dangerous for manned operations.
• Protection of U.S. forces: UAS allow the user to have a military presence in areas that would be otherwise politically impossible, capacity/resource prohibitive, too dangerous to risk being shot down, or
topographically inhospitable.
• Cost effectiveness: Although the actual costs of UAS vary depending on size, hardware, software, support crew, etc., some argue that UAS are more cost-effective than manned aircraft.
The Department of Defense’s (DoD) 2013 Industrial Capabilities Report noted that many aspects of UAS
make them a valuable tool for military and non-military markets in the near and long term: The Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) segment continues to evolve. As technology matures, operational lessons-learned are analyzed, and long-term strategies are developed beyond current conflicts. As evidenced
by their extensive use in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, UAS have proven themselves an effective tool
for the Warfighter. The capabilities they bring — from providing constant imagery to serving as strike platforms — are now virtually indispensable to combatant commanders.1
The benefits of military UAS, which are used to provide intelligence, surveillance or strike capabilities, have
been recognized by combatant commanders and intelligence services in the United States, but the technology remains only a small percentage of total investment in DoD research, development, and procurement.II
Non-military uses of UAS are vast and the commercial market for UAS will likely drive innovation in the
near future, both in the United States and abroad. However, concerns about U.S. controls on UAS export
and domestic restrictions have led some to worry that the future of the U.S. industry in UAS will be stifled
and that foreign competitors will overtake U.S. dominance of UAS technology. Indeed, as the DoD stated
in the 2013 Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap:
“…DoD’s total research, procurement, and sustainment costs are relatively small compared to the spending
on manned platforms… The civil UAS market also shows great promise and the potential applications are
virtually endless, if regulatory standards, certification, and operational procedures can be resolved for full
integration into the National Airspace System. Greater computing power, combined with developments
in miniaturization, sensors, and artificial intelligence, have and will continue to dramatically boost UAS
capabilities... However, there is concern that if the U.S. does not resolve export issues with respect to UAS,
this segment will suffer a fate similar to that of the U.S. satellite industry, where a dominant position in the
market was ceded to competitors because of unique U.S. export controls.”2

=======================================================================================================================

*** ** * ** ***

Describe
--------

**Scope \& aim.**   

Gray sets out to interrogate the 1990s debate on Revolutions in Military Affairs (RMAs), situating it within a general theory of strategy. He argues that RMAs are intellectual constructs rather than empirically discoverable phenomena. His central aim is to show that while the *character* of warfare often changes rapidly, the *nature* of war---political, adversarial, and subject to friction---remains constant.

**Structure \& arguments.**

* **Ch. 1 (High Concept):** RMAs are "fashionable" high concepts in strategic studies. Definitions (e.g., by Krepinevich, Cohen) overclaim, conflating military effectiveness with strategic effectiveness. RMAs are socially constructed debates, not objective ruptures.

* **Ch. 2 (Anatomy: Patterns in History?):** Dissects historical "waves" theories; warns of bias towards discontinuity and "tyranny of hindsight." RMAs are labelled after the fact, risking teleology.

* **Ch. 3 (Dynamics):** Proposes a nine-phase RMA life-cycle (gestation, strategic moment, maturation, decline). RMAs are gradual processes, not discrete events.

* **Ch. 4 (Chaos/Nonlinearity):** Rejects claim that war is fundamentally chaotic; war is complex and nonlinear, but strategy remains purposeful. Chaos theory misapplied to war risks fatalism.

* **Ch. 5 (Theory of Strategy):** Lays out a multidimensional theory: strategy is political, geographic, ethical, technological, human. RMAs must be understood as strategy in action, not separable "revolutions."

* **Ch. 9 (Strategy as a Duel):** Concludes with adversarial logic: every RMA is countered by an enemy over time; Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany, and the USSR illustrate how glittering military performance cannot overcome political and coalition dynamics.

**Key findings.**

* RMAs may sharpen tactical effectiveness, but adversarial adaptation erodes advantages.

* Political context is decisive; technology is never central alone.

* Strategic effectiveness ≠ military effectiveness.

* RMAs are useful concepts only if treated as heuristic tools, not objective categories.

*Limit → Implication:* Analysis ends before drones/AI → must test against post-2010 conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza) to validate scepticism.

*** ** * ** ***

Interpret
---------

**Relation to RQ.**

* **Evolution vs revolution.** Gray rejects the idea that RMAs transform the *nature* of war; at best they accelerate changes in *character*. For AI/UAS, this means no "revolution," only evolutionary adaptation tempered by adversarial response.

* **Mission command.** His rejection of centralised formulas supports mission command: decentralised initiative within commander's intent is resilient against complexity. Over-centralised AI-driven command would fall into the trap he critiques.

* **OODA/hyperwar.** Implicitly critiques hyperwar claims: decision acceleration does not remove friction or enemy adaptation. Compression of cycles may be temporary, not decisive.

* **Organisation \& elites.** Gray downplays "new elites": innovators may gain short-term advantage, but political/coalition structures are decisive.

* **Character of warfare.** Accepts that character changes rapidly (Napoleonic mass, WWI firepower, nuclear deterrence). AI/UAS could be such a shift, but the *nature*---politics, adversaries, friction---remains unchanged.

**Applicability.**   

For small states, Gray suggests caution: AI/UAS integration cannot substitute for strategic partnerships, resilient command culture, and political foresight.

*Limit → Implication:* His continuity bias risks underestimating cumulative disruptive potential of autonomy and ISR saturation.

*** ** * ** ***

Methodology
-----------

**Approach.** Conceptual + historical-comparative. Uses three case studies (Napoleonic, WWI, nuclear) as analogies. Draws on Clausewitz, complexity theory, and strategy theory.

**Strengths.**

* Clear theoretical framework linking RMA to strategy.

* Historical depth; critical of technocentric bias.

* Introduces RMA life-cycle, useful for comparing AI/UAS trajectories.

**Weaknesses.**

* Empirical base ends at Cold War.

* Little on irregular actors or small states.

* Written before AI, autonomy, drone swarming.

*Limit → Implication:* Requires supplementation with RAND/RUSI post-2010 studies to update empirical grounding.

*** ** * ** ***

Evaluate
--------

**Contribution.** Gray is the archetypal sceptic in the RMA debate. His Clausewitzian insistence on continuity and adversarial adaptation provides a vital counterweight to Krepinevich's optimism.

**Strengths.** Conceptual rigour; holistic theory of strategy; enduring relevance for mission command and scepticism about hyperwar.  

**Weaknesses.** Pre-dates AI/UAS empirical data; risks excessive continuity bias; underplays cumulative innovation.

**Quality rating.** High conceptual value, medium empirical relevance.

*Limit → Implication:* Alone, Gray risks biasing the review towards continuity; must be balanced with contemporary AI/UAS case studies.

*** ** * ** ***

(Autho)R
--------

**Colin S. Gray (1943--2020).** British-born strategist, professor at Reading, adviser to US/UK governments. Prolific writer, deeply Clausewitzian.

**Biases.** Preference for continuity, suspicion of technocentric US discourse, cultural conservatism in strategic thought.

*Limit → Implication:* His stance risks discounting real transformation---useful for critique, but must be checked against recent empirical evidence.

*** ** * ** ***

### One-sentence thesis

Gray argues that RMAs alter the *character* of warfare but never its *nature*, as political context and adversarial adaptation invariably erode technological or doctrinal advantages.

### Three implications (Limit → Implication)

1. **Continuity bias:** May underplay AI/UAS disruption → test against Ukraine/Gaza.

2. **Pre-2010 horizon:** No empirical AI/autonomy data → supplement with RAND/RUSI post-2015 studies.

3. **Clausewitzian frame:** Reinforces mission command for small states → but may miss disruptive potential of hyper-tempo.},

  comment     = {DIMER Analysis --- Andrew F. Krepinevich (2002) *The Military-Technical Revolution: A Preliminary Assessment* (CSBA)
====================================================================================================================

Describe
--------

**Scope \& aim.** Krepinevich assesses whether a major shift in warfare---labelled a "military-technical revolution" (MTR)---is underway, and what strategic management issues follow for defence leaders. He defines an MTR as the combination of new technologies, military systems, innovative operational concepts, and organisational adaptation that together "alter fundamentally the character and conduct of military operations" and yield order-of-magnitude effectiveness gains. He traces past revolutions, summarises Russian/Soviet theorising on reconnaissance-strike complexes (RSC), and sketches likely mission areas and organisational changes required to exploit the shift.

**Structure \& key arguments.** The report: (1) clarifies the concept and judges we are in an early transition akin to the early 1920s; (2) summarises Russian views and the RSC; (3) identifies technological pillars (information processing, precision strike, simulation), likely "sunrise" vs "sunset" systems, and operational concepts arrayed by mission (information dominance, space/air/sea control, strategic strikes, etc.); (4) argues organisational innovation is decisive yet hardest; and (5) poses management issues (how to identify and foster innovation, acquisition reform, role of allies). Core claims: information dominance is the sine qua non; integration across networks is decisive; simultaneous deep strikes will blur tactics/operations/strategy; and flatter, decentralised structures with centralised intent will be needed.

**Main findings.** The United States sits at an early stage of a long transition; technology alone is insufficient without operational and organisational innovation; mission-oriented joint integration will increasingly supplant service silos; information systems outpace legacy hierarchies; and defence management must incubate experimentation, new career paths, and agile acquisition to realise the MTR.

*Limit → Implication:* Early-2000s vantage point, largely U.S.-centric → later conflicts must be used to validate or qualify these forecasts before applying them to contemporary command debates.

*** ** * ** ***

Interpret
---------

**Relevance to RQ (evolution vs revolution; mission command; OODA/hyperwar; organisation; character of war).**

* **Evolution or revolution?** Krepinevich argues a genuine revolution is emerging if, and only if, technology is matched by operational and organisational change. He anticipates order-of-magnitude gains once RSC-like integration matures, suggesting more than incremental evolution. Yet he repeatedly notes we are "in the early stages" with no Coral Sea-style inflection point yet observed, tempering claims of a completed RMA.

* **Mission command.** He foresees decentralised execution under centralised control, enabled by direct access to information, flatter structures, and integration across domains. That maps to mission command principles of initiative within commander's intent, but also warns that information bottlenecks and legacy headquarters frustrate this---creating tension between hierarchy and autonomy.

* **OODA/hyperwar.** While not using the OODA label explicitly, his emphasis on time compression, first-mover advantage, and automated engagements implies accelerated decision cycles and "hair-trigger" postures consistent with hyper-tempo operations. Information dominance is framed as prerequisite and time is "the key variable."

* **Organisation \& "new elites."** He anticipates mission-oriented structures (space control, strategic strike) supplanting service lines, privileging integrators of ISR-strike networks---an emergent "elite" of integrators, system-of-systems architects, and technically literate commanders.

* **Character of warfare.** Blurring of tactical--operational--strategic levels via simultaneous, deep conventional strikes; aerospace operations linking space, UAVs, cruise missiles; sea denial through networks of sensors and precision fires; and ground's shift from closing to ranged fires. These collectively describe a changing character, contingent on integration and countermeasures.

**Applicability \& exclusions.** Applies most directly to technologically advanced states that can field integrated ISR-strike networks and reform acquisition. Less applicable to small neutral states with limited budgets, or hierarchical militaries with weak innovation cultures. Non-peer adversaries may focus on denial, deception, and first-strike incentives rather than information dominance.

**So what (Irish Defence Forces context).** The stress on decentralised execution and direct access to information dovetails with mission command in small professional forces. Yet the capital intensity of RSC-like integration implies selective adoption: sensors, EW, counter-UAS, and joint targeting skills over heavy platforms; investment in integrator talent and agile experimentation cells; and alliance interdependence for space-enabled ISR.

*Limit → Implication:* Focus on U.S. competition and global power projection → Ireland should adapt principles (mission-type tactics, integrator skills, counter-UAS, joint targeting with partners) rather than mirror U.S. force design.

*** ** * ** ***

Methodology
-----------

**Type \& design.** Conceptual net assessment with historical analogies and doctrinal inference. Synthesises Russian writings, interwar cases, Gulf War observations, and technology trends; proposes a mission-based operational taxonomy; articulates management issues. No formal empirical design, but structured analytic reasoning.

**Strengths.** Clear conceptual definition of MTR elements; historically grounded cautions on technology without organisational change; specific mission list as an evaluative frame; explicit managerial levers (experimentation, career paths, acquisition agility).

**Weaknesses.** Pre-AI deep learning era; limited treatment of irregular actors' adaptation; no systematic evidence on organisational reforms' efficacy; U.S. vantage point risks selection bias.

*Limit → Implication:* Absence of systematic data and pre-2010 tech horizon → use as theoretical scaffold, then test against Ukraine, Gaza and contemporary UAS/AI evidence in later DIMERs.

*** ** * ** ***

Evaluate
--------

**Contribution.** Provides a durable framework linking tech, operations, and organisation; legitimises "information dominance" as decisive; anticipates decentralised, network-centric command tensions. It remains a touchstone for discussing whether observed drone-ISR-strike integration constitutes a revolution or accelerated evolution.

**Convergence/divergence.** Converges with RMA optimists who stress networks and precision; diverges from sceptics who see continuity without organisational change. His own caveats---early stage, need for organisational innovation---temper deterministic techno-optimism and align with organisational realists.

**Value relative to field.** High conceptual value for framing the RQ's three pillars. However, contemporary validation must come from RAND/RUSI studies on Ukraine's sUAS, counter-UAS, and AI-enabled targeting to determine if his predicted "simultaneity" and decentralised execution have materialised.

*However.* The report presumes that integration yields advantage faster than countermeasures appear; recent conflicts show ubiquitous deception, EW, and attrition complicate clean information dominance, moderating the scale of advantage.

*Limit → Implication:* Conceptual, not empirical, and dated pre-AI wave → in the literature review, pair it with recent empirical work (e.g., RAND on Ukraine, RUSI on UAS protection) to calibrate claims of "revolution".

*** ** * ** ***

(Autho)R
--------

**Author \& stance.** Andrew F. Krepinevich, then Director at CSBA and former ONA staffer, operating within a U.S. defence transformation discourse. Institutional incentives favour anticipatory innovation and long-term competition framing. He explicitly credits Andrew Marshall's ONA for the assessment remit and emphasises management questions for senior DoD leaders.

**Likely biases.** U.S. strategic-competition lens, emphasis on high-end integration, and alliance assumptions. Less attention to small-state constraints and political risk in automation of kill chains.

*Limit → Implication:* Institutionally U.S.-centric → when applying to Ireland or other small European states, translate to scalable, partner-enabled pathways rather than wholesale structural overhaul.

*** ** * ** ***

### One-sentence thesis

Krepinevich argues that a genuine revolution in warfare is emerging only if militaries match new information-precision technologies with novel operations and organisational reform, with information dominance and network integration as decisive.

### Three implications (each as Limit → Implication)

* **Tech without structure:** Technology focus without organisational change → no decisive advantage → prioritise mission-command-compatible flatter structures and integrator roles before major platform buys.

* **Early-stage theory:** Early-transition, pre-AI evidence base → risk of over-claiming RMA → test predictions against Ukraine/Gaza empirical studies before asserting "revolution".

* **U.S. vantage point:** U.S.-centric, peer-competition framing → limited transferability to small neutral states → pursue niche capabilities (counter-UAS, EW, ISR fusion, joint targeting) and allied ISR access rather than full RSC replication.

### One actionable next step

Stand up a small joint experimentation cell to prototype "mission-type, networked" command for UAS/EW/ISR-strike integration using distributed simulation and field trials, with rapid lessons-to-force mechanisms (career credit for integrator officers).},

  abstract    = {Section II: Creativity and Complications: The Dark Side of UAS Use
and Emerging Technologies
The accessibility of commercial drones has led to an explosion in use of the devices by private citizens.
It has also contributed to the fairly rapid development of new ways to use UASs, from fighting forest
fires and assisting search-and-rescue missions to delivering packages and racing for sport. There is
an obvious benefit to society from these developments, as in many ways UASs can be used to gain efficiencies and to contribute to the public good. Indeed, as noted by Paul Scharre, “uninhabited systems
can not only save human lives by undertaking dangerous missions in their place, they can enable new
concepts of operation that would not be possible were human lives at risk.”292
While private-sector drone makers and software developers are providing the tools to enable UAS
exploration, the decentralization of UAS technology has created a playing field in which individual
users are limited only by their own imaginations and the various government regulations to which
they choose to abide—if the regulations even exist. In this way, when it comes to innovation in UAS
use, creativity is king. A number of emerging technologies like autonomy, miniaturization and swarms,
and further advancements and increased accessibility of sensors (e.g., forward looking infrared, known
by the acronym FLIR) and software (e.g., terrain mapping) will only perpetuate these UAS use trends
and extend the realm of the possible.
The dark side to all of this is that innocuous UAS use demonstrated by one person could be exploited by those with more sinister motives. To that end, and to demonstrate more fully what already lies
within the realm of the possible for a terrorist group, this section catalogs a number of creative ways
that drones have been used by private individuals who did not have terror intent, but whose UAS use
could be mimicked or repurposed by others to inflict harm. By focusing on what private citizens have
already achieved, we avoid the pitfalls associated with unconstrained brainstorming and “what-if”
scenario development about how drones can be used, and limit our discussion to those incidents to
which “proof of practicality” applies.293 The section concludes with a brief review of emerging technology trends, and discusses how they will complicate future�},

  abstract     = {While transformation means different things to different people, there are two main schools of thought on this subject. One identifies transformation exclusively with the revolution in military affairs (RMA) and the other perceives it more broadly, as a process of adapting the Armed Forces to the security challenges of the post-Cold War era.

Transformation is not synonymous with modernization. According to the U.S. Air Force Transformation Flight Plan, the former leads to major improvements in warfighting capabilities and the latter involves incremental upgrades. There is no single metric or framework that distinguishes among concepts that are transformational and those that are not. "In the end, determining what is transformational comes down to qualitative judgement calls by informed senior leadership."

To indicate that transformation is a matter of judgement implies that the process of defining it will continue to be debated by the military, with clear implications for service cultures, budgets, and programs. Subtle semantic and conceptual differences remain key to this struggle. Each service has an idea of future warfare, and rhetorical confusion is likely as various actors invoke terms differently. In the end, definitions alone will not resolve differences over transformation.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of military history shows that such a critical form of combat action as the defense was often underestimated with the result that armies were ill-prepared for it. Combat practice has on many occasions shown the erroneousness of views downplaying the role of the defense. As a rule, warring sides had to repulse enemy attacks on an ever growing scale and for increasing periods. Troops had to look for effective methods of preparation and conduct of the defense at the cost of heavy losses, correcting the mistakes that were made in military theory. The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 was not an exception in this regard.

Despite the fact that a number of advanced, forward-looking concepts of the military art evolved in the early 1930s (in particular, the theory of operation in depth), clearly insufficient consideration was given to the theory of preparation and conduct of defensive operations. As A.A. Svechin pointed out, the Red Army HS disrespect for the defense resulted from failure to understand the dialectic relationship between the offensive and the defensive. "He who cannot defend himself will not be able to mount a successful offensive," he stressed. "It is critical to use firm defense in order to prepare an effective offensive; an offensive operation needs a good foundation to build on." [1] The opinion of this outstanding military expert, however, was ignored.},

Some historians point to the period of post-Vietnam introspection in the mid-1970s as the origin. Thus the Nation has been engaged in--or at least on the cusp of--such a revolution (or military transformation) for the better part of two decades, a time span roughly equal to two earlier military revolutions, the interwar transformation and nuclear revolution.},

These changes are not only radical in nature but have increased in frequency and speed of implementation. Some of these changes have been merely shifts in how we think of military operations but some have been true revolutions in mill tary affairs (RMA) and, as such, have fundamentally changed how warfare affects the world.

History has proven that the sad truth of the fluid and more rapidly changing philosophies and tools of war is that they are usually only noticed after the fact, typically catching military (and political) leaders martially flat-footed. The true nature of RMA becomes readily apparent to militaries, which fall victim to the evolutionary principles of survival of the fittest and serve to demonstrate how those unaware of changing times are destined to be represented in textbooks as historical failures. Furthermore, for inexplicable reasons, both military and political leaders seemingly ignore the winds of change until they are consumed by the firestorm that usually accompanies revolutions of any nature. This "head-in-the sand" philosophy only further serves to make RMA more sudden and far reaching in impact.},

Bloch foresaw with stunning prescience how smokeless gunpowder, improved rifles, and other emerging technologies would overturn contemporary thinking about the character and conduct of war. (Bloch also got one major thing wrong: he thought the sheer carnage of modern combat would be so horrific that war would "become impossible.") What Bloch anticipated has come to be known as a "revolution in military affairs"--the emergence of technologies so disruptive that they overtake existing military concepts and capabilities and necessitate a rethinking of how, with what, and by whom war is waged. Such a revolution is unfolding today. Artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, ubiquitous sensors, advanced manufacturing, and quantum science will transform warfare as radically as the technologies that consumed Bloch. And yet the U.S. government's thinking about how to employ these new technologies is not keeping pace with their development.},

Given special access to classified data and key individuals involved in planning and executing the campaign, they argue persuasively that technological advances, including stealth, laser-guided munitions, and anti-radiation missiles, permitted air power to operate at unprecedented levels of effectiveness. But they also rigorously detail air power's limitations, including its inability to eliminate the Iraqi nuclear weapons program, neutralize the Scud missile threat, or shatter Saddam Hussein's hold on power through attacks on the Iraqi leadership. The book's liberal use of charts and tables--a number of which are difficult to read or interpret--both reward and punish the reader. But taken as a whole, the book presents as comprehensive an assessment of the role of air power in the war as is likely to be written for a long time.},

But even though the Soviets had an inkling of the changes in warfare that the late 20th century would bring, they did not have the technological base or the capability for creative organizational reform to actually undertake a revolution. They were the intellectual founding fathers of the current revolution in military affairs, but not its architects, playing the role of Marx rather than Lenin. But Americans were different.

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to discuss and assess the tension between ideas that underpin the revolution in military affairs (RMA) and the changing nature of post-Cold War conflict with specific reference to the nature of low-intensity conflict (LIC). The United States' (US) view of an RMA is used as a point of departure as it forms part of the mainstream thinking on the debate. It is argued that the conventional and inter-state war paradigm in the current RMA-debate seems largely irrelevant to the nature of LIC, which is the most probable type of conflict strong powers will face in future. The terror attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 reinforced this critique of the RMA vision and indicated the rise of asymmetric strategies. Hence this article discusses the tension between RMA-thinking and the nature of LIC, also considering the impact of September 11. It addresses the preparation for certain scenarios, existing national values, operational thinking and the use of military instruments.},
