To what extent have uncrewed and AI-enabled systems reshaped mission command, military organisation and the character of warfare in recent conflicts. Do these cumulative changes constitute a \gls{rma}?\index{Revolution in Military Affairs}\index{Artificial Intelligence}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mission Command
		\begin{itemize}
		\item How are uncrewed and AI-enabled systems reshaping the philosophy and practice of mission command?
		\item To what extent do concepts like the OODA loop and ``hyperwar” illustrate these changes?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Military Organisation and Structure
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How are Western militaries adapting their structures, force composition and professional cultures in response to uncrewed and AI systems?
			\item Are new ``elites” or organisational forms emerging, as predicted by RMA theorists?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Character of Warfare
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How have recent conflicts demonstrated changes in the conduct and character of war due to uncrewed and AI-enabled systems
			\item Do these cumulative changes amount to evolutionary adaptation or a true Revolution in Military Affairs?
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
